# End-to-end Multi-class Dog Breed Classification

This is notebook builds and end-to-end multi-class image classifier using Tensorlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub.

## Objective
Classify images into one of 120 dog breeds using deep learning techniques (transfer learning, fine-tuning).

## 1. Problem

Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog.

## 2. Data

The data we're using is from Kaggle's dog breed identification competition
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/data


## 3. Evaluation

The goal is to generate a file containing the **prediction probabilities** for each dog breed, for every image in the test set.

## 4. Features

Some information about the data:
* We're dealing with images (unstructured data) so it's probably best we use learning/transfer learning.
* There are **120 breeds** of dogs (this means there are 120 diffrent classes)
* There are around **10,000+ images** in training set (these images have labesl)
* There are around **10,000+ images** in the test set (these images have no labels)
